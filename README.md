### *1. Site Structure and URL Optimization*
#### *Issues Identified:*
- *Site Hierarchy*: The website’s structure lacked a clear categorization of content, making it difficult for users and search engines to navigate.

- *URLs*: Some URLs were lengthy and included unnecessary parameters, which can confuse both users and search engines.

#### *Improvements Made:*
- *Logical Hierarchy*: We reorganized the site into clear categories and subcategories for improved navigation. This ensures that all pages are only a few clicks away from the homepage, improving both SEO and user experience.
- *Breadcrumb Navigation*: Implemented breadcrumb navigation, which is now visible at the top of each page to show users where they are within the site’s structure.
- *URL Optimization*: Optimized URLs by making them shorter and including relevant keywords. For example, URLs such as /product?id=12345 were changed to /electric-bikes/model-name for better readability and SEO consistency.
